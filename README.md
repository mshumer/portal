# nav-answers

Simple repo demonstrating a new approach to AI-first answers engines. Current approaches are great when you're asking a question, but many Google queries are navigation-focused. Answers engines aren't useful here, and switching between Google and Perplexity, depending on what you're doing, is very annoying.

Instead, this approach uses a LLM to decide if a query requires an answer, or is looking for navigation, and takes the appropriate action.

For example, if you search for 'OpenAI', it'll bring you right to the OpenAI website!
